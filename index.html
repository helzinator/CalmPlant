    <!-- Observations -->
    <h2 class="top" id="user-observations">User Observations</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>ID #   Observation

1  To decide if they are going to water their plant, user 1 dips their finger in the soil and estimates
   the plants’ humidity. If the soil is dry enough, they water the plant.

2  To decide if they are going to water their plant, user 2 estimates the time between the last time
   they watered their plants and now. 2 weeks have passed since the last watering, so they decide
   that they should water their plants.

3  To decide if they are going to water their plant, user 3 looks at their plant watering schedule and
   waters their plant when the schedule tells them to.

4  This user only waters their plant with leftover water from their glasses and water bottles.

5  This user visually sees that their plant lacks water. They recognize that the soil is dry. They decide
   not to water their plants because they don’t have the motivation to do so.

6  This user waters their plants when their family and friends make comments on how dry the plants’
   soil is.

7  This user forgot to water their plant so often that it is now almost dead, so they have lost hope that
   the plant will survive and simply wait until it dries out completely.</pre></div>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <h2 class="top" id="identifying-the-problem">Identifying the problem</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>Most of the users estimate whether their plants need water. None of them knows for sure if their plant is
really in need of water. User #1 has to dirty their fingers by sticking them into dirt to check the soil humidity.
Their estimation could be wrong because they are only checking the surface level soil. User #2 waters their
plant when they estimate that enough time has passed. But some plants require watering every day, while
some can go a month without water and die easily from being overwatered. This behavior could lead to wrong
assumptions since every plant has different needs. User #4 only uses leftover water, which means that if there
is not a lot of excess water around, they could be under-watering their plant and killing it. User 3 has taken
into account all of the factors to know when to water their plants, but they end up having to keep track of a
calendar and update it over time. Our proposed system could tell them when to water their plant by knowing
exactly the appropriate humidity level for their plant.

Another issue we have seen with the users is that even when they know their plants require water, they
sometimes lack the motivation to water them. There is no immediate positive feedback once they water their
plants, and they don’t seem to care about watering their plants.

    <!-- Personas -->
    <h2 class="top" id="personas">Personas</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>Persona #1: Disorganized
This persona only waters their plant when they think about it or when the occasion to water their plant
presents itself. This groups the behaviours seen in user 2, 4 and 6. These users don’t have regular
patterns in their watering schedules, and instead rely on remembering periodically that they need to water
their plant, or someone else reminding them.

Persona #2: Structured
This persona knows when they have to water their plant. They rely on a self-made mechanism, but it
requires them to check it often. This groups the behaviours seen in user 1 and 3. Those users were grouped
because they water their plants on a regular basis and regularly check up on their plants to keep them
healthy.

Persona #3: Unmotivated
This persona generally feels unmotivated to take care of their plant and often gives up on their plant once
it looks unhealthy. This groups the behaviours seen in user 5 and 7. Those users were grouped because
they don’t take care of their plant until it is too late to revive it, and then give up on that plant.</pre></div>

    <!-- Use-case -->
    <h2 class="top" id="use-case-scenario">Use-case Scenario</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>For this use case, we will illustrate how our product could help someone with the disorganized persona.

Our user is moving through their apartment. Before, they weren’t paying attention to their plant, but now
they can see when they need to water their plant. They are used to seeing a green LED sensor, as they pay
attention to it in their peripheral vision. The next time they pass through, the light has turned yellow, and this
draws their attention. They find their closest water source, a glass of water and pour the water in. The sensors
stay yellow, so they go fetch more water with their glass, and the sensor turns green again.</pre></div>

    <!-- Related products -->
    <h2 class="top" id="related-products">Related products</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>Parrot Flower Power
This is a device that has a sensor device that is directly pressed into the soil. It is good because it has a very
accurate read on the humidity, moisture and air quality, but it is quite expensive at 80$+. Another downside
is that the device is connected to a mobile app. Without checking the app, the user is not able to know
whether they should water their plant.

Flower Care Sensor
This one has a slightly different design than the one above and does provide less data to the user, but it does
come at a lower cost. However, the same issue arises- the product is only useful when checking the associated
app.

Amazon Humidity Plant Monitor
A basic plant monitor that can be found on Amazon will provide the user with a small humidity scale indicating
if the plant needs to be watered. These are affordable, between 15 and 20 dollars, but they are difficult to read.</pre></div>

    <!-- Comparing -->
    <h2 class="top" id="comparing">Comparing Related Products to Our Solution</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>Our plant monitor does not have a mobile app associated. Having the barrier of checking an app makes it more
likely that the user will forget to water their plant. It is only half a product. For our product however, the
feedback that the user must water their plan will be directly indicated on the device. Having a LED monitor
would make it much more apparent to the user if the plant needs to be watered.

Persona #1, or the disorganized users, are unlikely to consistently check a mobile app or small humidity gauge,
meaning they may still forget to water their plants with competing products. Structured users, as in Persona #2,
who already rely on routines or schedules, might find existing app-based solutions useful, but they still require
extra steps that reduce efficiency. Finally, Persona #3d the unmotivated users, are the least likely to open an app
or interpret subtle indicators, so they especially benefit from our design’s immediate, visible feedback through
LEDs and simple emojis. By directly integrating feedback into the user’s environment, our solution addresses the
needs of all three personas more effectively than current market options</pre></div>

    <!-- High Level Design -->
    <h2 class="top" id="high-level-design">High Level Design</h2>
    <div class="aero">
      <pre>To design our system, we will use an arduino board to control the main logic of the system. We will read the
humidity of the soil of the plant by sticking a humidity sensor in the pot. The plant will have three states,
“Healthy”, “Dry”, and “Very Dry”. We will have a LCD display to portray the state of the plant, from a smiley
emoji when the plant is healthy (healthy state), to a neutral face emoji when it needs some water (dry state),
to a sad face emoji when the plants needs a lot of water (very dry). Similarly, LEDS light will go from green,
to yellow, to red, to display the three states of the plant. Lastly, we will have a button to let the user select
between three types of plants. Each type of plant will set their respective humidity thresholds.</pre>
      <img src="images/1.png" alt="Hardware requirements and setup" />
      <pre>Figure 1: Hardware requirements and setup. On the left, the overall system. On the right, the Arduino
connections with the other hardware.

We will provide a guide to the user to help them figure out which mode is best for their plants. Below are the
three plants types we will be using:

Plant type    Description                         Example
Hydrophytes   High water needs / Water loving     • Ferns (e.g., Boston Fern, Bird's Nest Fern)
                                                  • Alocasia (Elephant Ear)
                                                  • Calathea

Mesophytes    Moderate needs / Average conditions • Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)
                                                  • Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)
                                                  • Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)
                                                  • Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)
                                                  • Philodendron (most varieties)
                                                  • Dracaena (e.g., Dragon Tree)
                                                  • Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura)

Xerophytes    Low Water Needs / Drought tolerant  • Cactus
                                                  • Succulents (e.g., Jade Plant - Crassula ovata, Aloe Vera, Echeveria,
                                                    Haworthia, Kalanchoe)
                                                  • Snake Plant
                                                  • ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)
                                                  • Ponytail Palm (Beaucarnea recurvata)
                                                  • Agave

For the software, we will build a simple state machine. In the main loop, we will check for the humidity value and
update the state of the machine based on that. See figure 2 for the state machine diagram. Depending of the
humidity value we read, we will update the LED lights and the LCD display.</pre>
      <img src="images/2.png" alt="State machine diagram of the software" />
      <pre>Figure 2: State machine diagram of the software.

On Figure 3, you will see a high-level implementation of the main loop. We will poll for the humidity value and
update the lights and display accordingly. On figure 3, you will also see a high-level implementation for the button.
It will be an interrupt that switches the “type of plant” mode, as described on Table 1.</pre>

    <!-- LOW-FI PROTOTYPE (before appendices) -->
    <h2 class="top" id="low-fidelity-prototype">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <div class="aero">
<pre>Section 1: Design Concepts:

Idea #1 : LCD screen
The user checks this lcd screen to know if they have to water their plant

Idea #2 : LED flower
LED in 3D printed flower stuck to the pot. Green for good, yellow for ok and red for bad

Idea #3: Mechanical flower
As the soil gets dryer the flower closes.

Idea #4: Extending flower
The length of the flower varies depending on the soil. Fully out means good and fully in means bad

Idea #5: Spinning flower
The spinning speed varies depending on the soil. Not spinning means good and spinning fast means bad.

Idea #6: Proximity beeping
Will beep if bad and the proximity sensor is triggered

Idea #7: Digital Hourglass
A digital hourglass that tracks the time until the plant needs to be watered next based on humidity levels
in the pot and time estimation of the evaporation.

Idea #8:
Plays music if the plant needs water
- Over watered: Titanic theme song
- Needs water: A cowboy theme music reminiscent of the deserts of the far west.

Phase 2 – Ideas to prototype

Idea #1
For this idea it was decided to combine the lcd idea with the led idea to create a polyvalent system that
yields basic information from afar and detailed feedback when close by.

The led will represent the state of the plant for afar and the screen will do the same thing when close but
also allow the user to have more detailed information on the plant and navigate the menu with a joystick.
All of this will be stuck on the pot of the plant.

Idea #2
For this idea we reused the spinning flower and a bit of the extending prototype for its height to yield
information from afar.

The speed of the fan is influenced by soil and a num pad allows for basic mode navigation. The fan is to be
put on the edge of the pot.</pre>

    <!-- Usability Goals -->
    <h2 class="top" id="usability-goals">Usability Goals</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>A convincing rationale is offered for the described usability goals; the benchmark tasks are appropriate for
these goals, relate to the most important elements of system functionality, and only tell the user what (and not
how) to do.

Users should be able to complete the installation process of the device in under 15 minutes.
Rational: The design should be minimalist to reduce the cognitive load. The device should be easy to install
to improve usability and satisfaction with the product.

Users should clearly be able to view the status of the plant at a glance from a maximal distance of 5 meters.
Rational: The main goal of the device is to inform the user of the state of the plant by impowering their
peripheral information. Users are usually seeing the potted plants when they are inside their home, so a distance
of 5 meters is reasonable. Also, based on the 10 heuristic goals, users should always be able to see what is
going on with the system through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

The system should give feedback to the user on the state of the plant’s soil after it has been watered, with a
maximum delay of 1 minute.
Rational: It is important for the user to have feedback on their action of watering the plant. The system should
let the user know if they made an error while performing the action, such as watering too much or too little.</pre></div>

    <!-- Test Materials -->
    <h2 class="top" id="test-materials">Test Materials</h2>
    <div class="aero"><pre>5.1: Observer Briefing:
The observer will first introduce the context of the test to the end user based on the information found in
section 5.2. Then, the end-user, also called the evaluator, shall fill out the pretest questionnaire found in
section 5.3. Then, the observer should start the recording of the user test. They shall give the user the test
script found in section 5.6. The observer shall record what happens during the evaluation in the appropriate
data collection sheet, which can be found in the section 5.7. They should not interact with the user, and let
the user make their own decisions. If the user is stuck an cannot proceed with the task, then they can guide
them to proceed with the test and record this in the datasheet in the comment section. Once the user is done
with all the tasks, they should stop the recording and hand the user the post-questionnaire which can be found
in section 5.8.

5.2: User Introduction:
Hi and thank you for taking part in this short usability test. The goal today is to see how intuitive and practical
our “Calm Plant Watering Alert” system feels when you’re using it for the first time. This isn’t a test of you or
your abilities, it’s a test of our design, so please don’t worry about doing everything ‘perfectly’.

We will ask you to interact with a low-fidelity paper prototype that represents the basic layout and functions of
our product. As you go through the tasks, please try to think out loud. Share what you notice, what confuses
you, or what feels natural. Your honest reactions will help us understand what’s working and what we could
improve in the next version.

If at any point you feel uncomfortable or unsure, you can pause or stop the test. The session should take
about 10-15 minutes. Thank you again for helping us!

5.3: Pretest Questionnaire:
(questions as listed in the Low-Fidelity Prototype document)

5.4: User/Training Documentation:
The documentation that will be presented to the user is the pre-test questionnaire in 5.3, the test script in 5.6
in an electrical format, the post-test questionnaire found in 5.8, and the two paper prototypes presented in
section 2. There is no additional documentation.

5.5: Tasks Description:
(identical tasks 1–7 as summarized in Benchmark Tasks)

5.6: Test Script:
1. Setup the device on your potted plant.
2. Select the appropriate device mode for your type of plant.
3. Determine the current water needs of the plant. State your finding out loud.
4. Decide if you want to water the plant or not. State your decision out loud and explain your rationale.
5. Water the plant based on its water needs.
6. Determine the current state of the plant. State your finding out loud.
7. Decide if you want to water the plant or not. State your decision out loud and explain your rationale.

Prototype: 2- Spinning flower — Participant: Dawn Hoffer
Setup: Understood the flow right away
Interface Experience: Confused about what to click
Feedback: Wanted more context beyond watering (Sunlight, overwatering)
Likes: Appreciated simplicity, said anyone could do it.
Comments: Expand for sunlight and overwatering

Observations Table

General Success
All participants completed every task successfully. Setup was universally described as quick and easy. LED color
cues were intuitive and effective, whereas height was also a simple indicator.

Main Usability Challenges
The joysticks caused confusion, especially with mode selection. Participants using the numpad were unclear of what
the buttons did each time.

Prototype Comparison
The simple to see height difference allowed the users to see from a distance whether the plant needed to be watered.
However, users still valued LED system for its clear visual cues from peripheral vision.

User Preferences
Participants preferred systems that feel calm, minimal and easy to read at a glance. The combination of LED indicators
for peripheral awareness as well as the large height indicator allowed users to understand clearly what is going on.

Next Steps
Combine the LED indicator’s clarity with the touchscreen’s interactivity. Simplify mode selection of numbad and
ensure immediate, visible feedback after watering. Consider expanding functionality to address overwatering and
sunlight exposure.</pre></div>
